				<h2 class="ai-header">Building your first app: HelloCodi</h2>

				<p>
					Now that you've set up your computer and device, and you've learned
					how the Designer and the Blocks Editor work, you are ready to build
					the HelloCodi app. At this point, you should have the Designer or
					Blocks Editor open in your browser, and an Android/iOS device or
					emulator connected for testing while build. (See
					<a href="/explore/ai2/setup">Setup Instructions for App Inventor</a>
					if you do not have these things running.) Choose Start a New Project
					from the Projects menu and name it HelloCodi.
				</p>

				<h3>HelloCodi: Tap the Bee, Hear the Bee Buzz!</h3>
				<p>
					HelloCodi is a simple app that you can build in a very short time. You
					create a button that has a picture of Codi the bee on it, and then
					program the button so that when it is clicked the phone will make a
					buzzing sound.
				</p>

				<p>
					To build HelloCodi, you'll need an image file of Codi the bee.
					Download these files to your computer by clicking the following links.
					To download: after clicking a link, right click on the image and
					select "Save As." Save the file onto your desktop or downloads folder,
					or anywhere that you can easily find it later.
				</p>

				<ul>
					<li>
						Codi picture:
						<a href="/explore/sites/all/files/ai2tutorials/helloCodi/codi.jpg">
							codi.jpg</a
						>
						(Right-click and Save)
					</li>
					<li>
						Bee sound:
						<a
							href="/explore/sites/all/files/ai2tutorials/helloCodi/Bee-Sound.mp3"
						>
							Bee-Sound.mp3</a
						>
						(Right-click and Save)
					</li>
				</ul>

				<h3>Select components to design your app</h3>

					</div>
					<div class="col-sm-9">
						<p>
							The App Inventor <b>Components</b> are located on the left hand
							side of the <em>Designer Window</em> under the title
							<b>Palette</b>. Components are the basic elements you use to make
							apps on an Android phone or iPhone. They're like the ingredients
							in a recipe. Some components are very simple, like a
							<b>Label</b> component, which just shows text on the screen, or a
							<b>Button</b> component (#1 left) that you tap to initiate an
							action.
						</p>

						<p>
							Other components are more elaborate: a drawing <b>Canvas</b> that
							can hold still images or animations, an
							<b>Accelerometer</b> sensor that works like a Wii controller and
							detects when you move or shake the phone, components that send
							text messages, components that play music and video, components
							that get information from Web sites, and so on.
						</p>
					</div>
				</div>

				<p>
					To use a component in your app, you need to click and drag it onto the
					viewer in the middle of the <b>Designer</b>. When you add a component
					to the <b>Viewer</b> (#1 below), it will also appear in the components
					list on the right hand side of the Viewer.
				</p>

				<p>
					<strong>Components</strong> (#2 below) have adjustable properties.
					These properties change the way the component appears or behaves
					within the app. To view and change the <strong>Properties</strong> of
					a component (#3 below), you must first select the desired component in
					your list of components.

				<h3>Steps for selecting components and setting properties</h3>

				<p>
					<span style="color: green">HelloCodi</span> will have a
					<b>Button</b> component that displays the image of the bee you
					downloaded earlier. To accomplish this:
				</p>

				<p>
					<b>Step 1a</b>. From the <b>User Interface</b> palette, drag and drop
					the <b>Button</b> component to Screen1 (#1).
				</p>

				<p>
					<b>Step 1b</b>.To give the button the image of the bee, in the
					<b>Properties</b> pane, under Image, click on the text
					<em>"None..."</em> and click <em>"Upload File..."</em> (#2). A window
					will pop up to let you choose the image file. Click "Browse" and then
					navigate to the location of the <em>codi.jpg</em> file you downloaded
					earlier (#3). Click the <em>codi.jpg</em> file, click "Open", and then
					click "OK".
				</p>

				<div class="row">
					<div class="col-md-1"></div>
					<div class="col-md-10">
						<img
							src="/explore/sites/all/files/ai2tutorials/helloCodi/upload.png"
							style="border: grey solid 1px; width: 100%"
							alt="screenshot for uploading media"
						/>
					</div>
					<div class="col-md-1"></div>
				</div>

				<p>
					<b>Step 2</b>. Change the Button's <b>Text</b> property:<br />Delete
					"Text for Button1", leaving the Button's text property blank so that
					there is no writing over the bee image.
				</p>
				<div class="row">
					<div class="col-sm-4"></div>
					<div class="col-sm-3">
						<img
							src="/explore/sites/all/files/ai2tutorials/helloCodi/text-properties.png"
							style="width: 100%; border: grey solid 1px"
							alt="screenshot of text properties"
						/>
					</div>
					<div class="col-sm-5"></div>
				</div>

				<p>
					<b>Step 3</b>. From the <b>User Interface</b> palette, drag and drop
					the <b>Label</b> component to the Viewer <strong>(#1)</strong>,
					placing it below the picture of the bee. It will appear under your
					list of components as <strong>Label1</strong>.
				</p>

				<p>Under the <b>Properties</b> pane, change the</p>
				<ul style="list-style: none">
					<li>
						<b>(2) Text</b> property of Label1 to read "Touch the Bee". You'll
						see the text change in the Designer and on your device.
					</li>
					<li><b>(3) FontSize</b> to 30.</li>
					<li>
						<b>(4) BackgroundColor</b> of Label1 by clicking on the box. You can
						change it to any color you like.
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>(5) TextColor</b> to any color you like. (Note: if
						BackgroundColor and TextColor are the same, you will not be able to
						read your text!)
					</li>
				</ul>
				Here, the background color is set to aqua and the text color is set
				blue.
				<p></p>

							style="border: grey solid 1px; width: 100%"
							alt="screenshot of setting properties for Lable1"
						/>
					</div>
					<div class="col-md-2"></div>
				</div>

				<p>
					<b>Step 4</b>. Under Palette, click on the <b>Media</b> drawer and
					drag out a <b>Sound</b> component and place it in the Viewer (#1).
					Wherever you drop it, it will appear in the area at the bottom of the
					Viewer marked <b>Non-visible components</b>. Under the Media pane,
					Click Upload File... (#2) Browse to the location of the
					<em>Bee-Sound.mp3</em> file that you downloaded earlier and upload it
					to this project (#3). Under the Properties pane, see that the Source
					property currently says None.... Click the word None... to change the
					Sound1 component's Source to <em>Bee-Sound.mp3</em> (#4).

					</div>
					<div class="col-md-2"></div>
				</div>

				<h3>Programming with the Blocks Editor</h3>
				<p>
					So far you have been arranging your app's screen and components in the
					<em>Designer</em>, which is in a web browser window. To start
					programming the behavior of the app, you need to go to the
					<em>Blocks Editor</em>. Click the Blocks button in the upper right of
					your screen to go to the Blocks Editor.
				</p>
				<div class="row">
					<div class="col-md-1"></div>
					<div class="col-md-10">
						<img
							src="/explore/sites/all/files/ai2tutorials/helloCodi/blocks.png"
							style="border: grey solid 1px; width: 100%"
							alt="switch to blocks editor button"
						/>
					</div>
					<div class="col-md-1"></div>
				</div>

				<p>
					Once you have the Blocks Editor in front of you, continue to the next
					step to start programming your app with blocks.
				</p>

				<h3>Playing the Sound</h3>

				<p>
					<b>Step 1</b>. On the left side of the Blocks Editor, click the
					<b>Button1</b> drawer to open it. Drag and drop the
					<span class="controlblock-ai2">when Button1.Click</span> block in the
					work area (the open area on the right).
				</p>

				<div class="row">
					<div class="col-md-3"></div>
					<div class="col-md-6">
						<img
							src="/explore/sites/all/files/ai2tutorials/helloCodi/buttonblocks.png"
							style="border: grey solid 1px; width: 100%"
							alt="screenshot of button.click block"
						/>
					</div>
					<div class="col-md-3"></div>
				</div>

				<p>
					Those mustard yellow blocks are called <b>event handler</b> blocks.
					The event handler blocks specify how the mobile device should respond
					to certain events: a button has been pressed, the phone is being
					shaken, the user is dragging her finger over a canvas, etc.
					<span class="controlblock-ai2">when Button1.Click</span> is an event
					handler.
				</p>

				<p>
					<b>Step 2a</b>. Click the <b>Sound1</b> drawer and drag the
					<span class="callblock-ai2">Sound1.Play</span> block and connect it to
					the "do" section of the
					<span class="controlblock-ai2">when Button1.Click</span> block. The
					blocks connect together like puzzle pieces and you can hear a clicking
					sound when they connect.
				</p>

				<div class="row">
					<div class="col-md-3"></div>
					<div class="col-md-6">
						<img
							src="/explore/sites/all/files/ai2tutorials/helloCodi/soundblocks.png"
							style="border: grey solid 1px; width: 100%"
							alt="Sound.Play blocks"
						/>
					</div>
					<div class="col-md-3"></div>
				</div>

				<p>
					The purple blocks are called <b>command</b> blocks, which are placed
					in the body of event handlers. When an event handler is executed, it
					runs the sequence of commands in its body. A command is a block that
					specifies an action to be performed (e.g., playing sound) when the
					event (e.g., pressing Button1) is triggered.
				</p>

				<p>Your blocks should look like this at this point:</p>
				<div class="row">
					<div class="col-md-3">
						<img
							src="/explore/sites/all/files/ai2tutorials/helloCodi/button1click.png"
							style="width: 100%"
							alt="button.click blocks"
						/>
					</div>
					<div class="col-md-9"></div>
				</div>

				<p>
					Now you can see that the <b>command block</b> is in the
					<b>event handler</b>. This set of blocks means; "when Button1 is
					clicked, Sound1 will play." The event handler is like a category of
					action (e.g., a button is being clicked), and the command specifies
					the type of action and the details of the action (e.g., playing a
					sound).
				</p>

				<p>
					You can read more about the blocks and how they work here:
					<a href="http://ai2.appinventor.mit.edu/reference/blocks/"
						>App Inventor Built-in Blocks</a
					>.
				</p>

				<p>
					Try it out on your device or with the emulator! When you press the
					button you should hear the bee buzz. Congratulations, your first app
					is running!
				</p>

				<pre class="box">
Note: there is a known issue with the Sound component on some devices. If you see an "OS Error" and the sound does not play - or is very delayed in playing, go back into the Designer and try using a Player component (found under Media) instead of the Sound component.</pre

				<h3>Packaging your app</h3>

				<p>
					While your phone/tablet/emulator has been connected to App Inventor,
					your app has been running in real time on your device. If you
					disconnect the device/emulator, the app will vanish. You can always
					make it return by reconnecting the device, but to have an app running
					without being connected to App Inventor, you must "<b>package</b>" the
					app to produce an application package (apk file).
				</p>

				<p>
					For now, this last step, packaging apps, only works for Android
					phones. We are actively working to bring this capability to iOS
					devices soon!
				</p>
				<p>
					To "package" the app to install on your device or to send to someone
					else, click the <strong>Build</strong> tab at the top of the screen.
					Under Build, there are two options available for you to choose from:
				</p>

				<div class="row">
					<div class="col-md-6">
						<img
							src="/explore/sites/all/files/ai2tutorials/helloCodi/package.png"
							style="border: grey solid 1px; width: 100%"
							alt="package menu in App Inventor"
						/>
					</div>
					<div class="col-md-6"></div>
				</div>

				<p>
					1. <b>App (provide QR code):</b> You can generate a Barcode (a QR
					Code), which you can use to install the app on a mobile device that
					has a camera.
				</p>

				<p style="color: red">
					this barcode is only good for two hours. If you want to share your app
					with others via barcode over a longer period, you'll need to download
					the .apk file to your computer and use a third-party software to
					convert the file into a barcode. More information can be found
					<a href="/explore/ai2/share">here</a>.
				</p>

				<p>
					2. <b>App (save to my computer):</b> You can download the app to your
					computer as an apk file, which you can distribute and share as you
					like by manually installing it on other devices (sometimes called
					<a
						href="http://www.techrepublic.com/blog/smartphones/how-to-side-load-apps-on-your-android-device/3114"
						target="blank"
						>"side loading"</a
					>).
				</p>

				<h4>Review</h4>

				<p>Here are the key ideas covered so far:</p>

				<ul>
					<li>
						You build apps by selecting components (ingredients) and then
						telling them what to do and when to do it.
					</li>
					<li>
						You use the <strong>Designer</strong> to select components and set
						each component's properties. Some components are visible and some
						aren't.
					</li>
					<li>
						You can add media (sounds and images) to apps by uploading them from
						your computer.
					</li>
					<li>
						You use the <strong>Blocks Editor</strong> to assemble blocks that
						define the components' behavior
					</li>
					<li>
						<span class="controlblock-ai2">when ... do ...</span> blocks define
						<em>event handlers</em>, that tell components what to do
						<em>when</em> something happens.
					</li>
					<li>
						<span class="callblock-ai2">call ...</span> blocks tell components
						to do things.
					</li>
				</ul>

				<h4 class="ai-header">Scan the Sample App to your Phone</h4>

				<p>
					Scan the following barcode onto your phone to install and run the
					sample app.
